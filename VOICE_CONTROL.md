1. **Speak Clearly**: Use a normal speaking voice
2. **Quiet Environment**: Reduce background noise for better recognition
3. **Wait for Feedback**: The app will confirm what it heard
4. **Natural Language**: You can say variations like:
   - "Next" or "Next step" or "Go forward"
   - "Back" or "Previous" or "Go back"
   - "Start the timer" or "Begin timer"

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Stored**: Voice commands are processed locally in your browser
- **No Cloud Processing**: Uses your browser's built-in speech recognition
- **Microphone Access**: Only active when you click the mic button
- **Automatic Shutoff**: Mic turns off after each command

## Troubleshooting

- Try using Chrome, Edge, or Safari

### "No speech detected" error

- Speak louder or closer to the microphone
